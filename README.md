An online supermarket management system enables management staff, warehouse staff, saler and customer to use:
- Management staff: view the types of statistics: items, suppliers and revenue.
- Warehouse staff: import goods from suppliers, manage (add, delete, change) item information and supplier information, browse online orders and export to delivery staff.
- Saler: selling goods at the counter to customers.
- Customer: register as a member, search, order online, buy directly at the counter.

Considering two modules and answering questions:
- **Warehouse staff edits item information:** selects the item management menu → selects the function to edit item information → finds items by name to edit → enters item information and clicks edit → the system saves information to the database.
- **Customer orders online:** choose to order → Repeats the following steps until the end of ordered item: chooses to find items by name → enters quantity → repeats until all items are out, then goes to cart submit → save order.
